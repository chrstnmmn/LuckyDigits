# JAVA PROJECT 101

#### Hi everyone, I'm excited to share my first ever Java project with you. This is part of my journey learning how to code, and it's also a way for me to track my progress as I work on improving myself this year. :blush::blush:

---

## This project is all about guessing the right number that is randomly generated.

> How to run:
> - Just click the .exe file to run the program
> - Its more easy and convenient if you want a preview of the system without opening the source code.

#### Here is the algorithm:
> - Start
> - Generating a random number
> - Asking the user to guess the right number with only 7 attempts
> - Getting the user input
> - Checking if the user's guessed is within the range of the random number
> - If the input is above the range, prompt the user it's too high
> - If the input is below the range, prompt the user it's too low
> - Prompt the user how many attempts left
> - Check if the user got the right random number
> - If true, then prompt the user that they've won, and prompt how many attempts left.
> - If false, then prompt the user that they've lost
> - Ask the user if they want to play again or exit
> - If "play again", run the system back
> - If "exit" close the system
> - End
